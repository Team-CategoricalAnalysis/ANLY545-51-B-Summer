Remember to write your thoughts as a book report.
I expect the same _content_ as your presentation, but the working should reflect the new medium.

# Reproduction

Reproduce the work, **exactly as presented**, of the group that came before you (see People in Canvas).

We are replicating Team 7's work from the earlier phase.


# Evaluate

Evaluate if the result (identical or different) are still useful.

1. Did **the other team's** prompts help fill in **your** understanding of the paper?
2. Did **the other team's** prompts miss the mark in a meaningful way?
