Remember to write your thoughts as a book report.
I expect the same _content_ as your presentation, but the working should reflect the new medium.

# Read and Review

Individually read and review the paper.
As a group, please summarize your thoughts including the following:

1. How original is the topic?

    Ans: In my opinion, this topic is not truly original topic. Upon doing some research, there are some other papers related to this same topic.

2. What is the main question addressed by the research?

    Ans: The main question is whether LR or NN has better performance in healthcare.


3. Are the conclusions consistent with the evidence and arguments presented?

    Ans: The conclusion of the paper is that complex model NN has slightly better performance but with heavy expense(increased complexity, time, computation power, and etc). And the evidence presented in the paper is consistent with this conclusion.
With the provided charts and plot, itâ€™s clear that NN is slightly better performance but the clinical significance is uncertain.


# A.I Help

Pretend that ChatGPT (or similar tool) is a new team member.
Ask ChatGPT to contribute to the group project.
Keep diligent notes as to your conversation.
Science is about reproducibility, if your classmates can not repeat the process using your steps, you will be marked down in the next assignment.

### Steps:
1. Open ChatGPT website and sign-in.
2. Type `Hi, I would like you to read a paper, and answer few questions.` ChatGPT would respond `of course, etc etc....`
3. paste the paper into the chat and send
4. ChatGPT would automatically generate a summary response. 
5. Type 'question 1: how original is the topic`
6. ChatGPT responds with topic
7. Type `question 2: What is the main question addressed by the research?`
8. ChatGPT responds with results.
9. Type `question 3: Are the conclusions consistent with the evidence and arguments presented?`
10. ChatGPT failed to examine but provided methods we could follow to examine ourselves.
11.(optional) I tried re-phase my question, but ChatGPT gave the same response.




# Compare and contrast

Compare and contrast what you, as a human team member, _understood_ to what ChatGPT, as an A.I. team member, _understood_.

1. Did ChatGPT help fill in your understanding of the paper? 
No, but ChatGPT did provide a more detailed and well-organized response.

2. Did ChatGPT miss the mark in a meaningful way?
Yes, ChatGPT was not able to handle question 3.
